    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to make a movie recommendation system. We will use the “Movies Daily Update Database”, which has over 500,000 unique movies, each with 20 different attributes listed (including overview, popularity, budget, etc.). Using this dataset, we will cluster the movies together, then perform hyperparameter estimation to figure out the general clusters that the movies are separated into. Through this, we will create a system that allows users to input the title of a movie they like and receive a list of similar movies: movies from the same cluster, as measured in Euclidean space. Some of these movies may be a bit further away from the input movie to provide diversity, but they will still originate from the same cluster. Performance will be assessed by comparing the recommended movies generated by our system with the “Recommendations” column in the dataset, which has the TMDB Dataset ID of similar movies that The Movie Database recommends.

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we have always thought that advancement of technology would continue to make things more accessible to the public, too much accessibility can cause stagnance in information searching. Information is increasing exponentially where it reached “64.2 zettabytes in 2020. Over the next five years up to 2025, global data creation is projected to grow to more than 180 zettabytes… The growth was higher than previously expected caused by the increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as more people worked and learned from home and used home entertainment options more often”<a name=\"taylor\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#taylornote).  Especially in terms of the entertainment industry, due to the overabundance of new movies, books, and other forms of media being produced at such fast rates, consumers can be easily overwhelmed with the amount of media they have to sift through. To overcome this plethora of information, we can use machine learning to analyze patterns and predict preferences based on various demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study done by Jayalakshmi, Ganesh, Čep, and Murugan seeks to create an effective movie recommendation system by describing the challenges of the system and increasing its accuracy. In order to effectively suggest movies to users, there are three types of methods they discussed. One is collaborative filtering which analyzes user information/history. They look at what the user and users with the same demographic (age, sex, etc.) have watched in order to figure out a pattern in preferences. Content-based filtering looks at only the content of the movies and eliminates the problem where some users of the same demographic might not necessarily have the same taste in movies. Some examples they gave of content-based filtering is looking at the genre or the key characters of the movie. Lastly, context-based filtering takes into account how preferences stay the same across different platforms where “if both people are attracted to Christmas movies from Netflix, it is most likely that they will still like Christmas movies by Showmax”<a name=\"jayalakshmi\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#jayalakshminote). These strategies and a combination of these strategies can be effective ways to sort information especially with the threat of information overflow.  "

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there is an overabundance of recommender systems that exist for public use, ranging from quizzes online to more official recommendations like that of Netflix or Tinder. However, as a group, we began wondering about the accuracy of these systems, specifically of those on streaming platforms. The problem we will be solving is thus determining whether we can train a model that can more accurately recommend movies based on similarity to an individual’s favorite movies more accurately than that of the IMDB recommendation system. We will utilize clustering in GMM to create clusters that will detail the movies closest together as measured in Euclidean space. The success of the recommendation system can be measured through metrics such as the silhouette score for cluster quality. The problem of movie recommendation is easily replicable due to the constant release of new films. Additionally, the usefulness of our recommendation system is not limited to films alone, as it will be able to successfully recommend other things with similar information (such as TV shows and cartoons), thus ensuring the relevance of our project.

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To create recommendations, we aim to use a **clustering algorithm to identify groups of movies based on characteristics** like genre, plot keywords, cast, language, release date, etc, and then use metrics such as the reviews and the Euclidean distance in the feature space to determine if a given movie within a cluster should be recommended to the individual. We think this solution is likely to provide good results, as both steps should help narrow down the hundreds of thousands of possible movies from this dataset into a small selection of good-quality recommendations based on specific movies. The first step aims to subsection the data into smaller groups of similar movies based on the general criteria used to decide the type of movie. For example, this step would help people narrow their focus down to only a selection of action/superhero movies if they really enjoy the Marvel franchise. Then from there, the second step aims to collect a subset of the movies in this larger class based on their quality. While there may be a movie that in terms of genre and cast is relatively similar to one you enjoy, if the movie itself isn’t good you probably won’t appreciate the recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will likely use a model from the sklearn clustering methods to form the basis of the first section, and then follow it with a supervised model to generate the output of specific movie recommendations. We will likely need to take some steps to organize the data in a more usable form, such as using one-hot encoding for the many categorical variables, using standardization to account for the drastic differences in magnitude between things like revenue and scores, or potentially using dimensionality reduction to manage the significant number of dimensions that will be created after one-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While many other services do movie recommendations, due to the nature of differences (such as the different datasets or them using large collections of user preferences), there isn’t a clear example to test against. However, we do still have metrics for evaluating them. This data is scraped from TMDB which has its own suggestions of movies to watch, which will be used as a comparison for the quality of the mode.\n"

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In our proposed dataset (Movies Daily Update Dataset), the original site the data is scraped from contains a list of recommended movies. We aim to treat this as a form of benchmark model that can be used as a comparison for our proposed solution, and also as a means of calculating an adjusted rand index. The recommendations from TMDB form a kind of cluster, where we can check if two items belong to the same cluster based on whether they show up in the recommendation of each other. Unfortunately, as we don’t know how TMDB creates their recommendations, we will be unable to truly test it as a benchmark model, as we can’t evaluate any internal performance of it. Additionally, we will use the Silhouette coefficient to have a better means of evaluating our overall clusters, given that we have no real ground truths for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **rand index** is a metric for comparing two distinct clustering methods by comparing pairs of data points and their respective clusters in each. For example, if two data points are in the same cluster in algorithm A, and they are in the same cluster in algorithm B, then the rand index would be higher, while if they are in the same cluster in algorithm A but different clusters in algorithm B, then the rand index would be lower. This works in the context of using the TMDB recommendations as in our model to be recommended you would have to belong to the same cluster. The adjusted rand index is just a version of the rand index which considers the likelihood of agreement due to random chance. The formula for the rand index is given by R = $\\frac{a + b}{a + b + c + d}$ where $a$ is the number of points in the same cluster in both, $b$ is the number of points in different clusters in both, and $c$ and $d$ are the number of points which have disagreements between the two clusterings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **silhouette coefficient** on the other hand is an internal evaluation of a single model. This is calculated by comparing the mean distance between a point and all other points of the same cluster, to the smallest mean distance between that point and all points of a different cluster. This means if a cluster is well formed, and all points are relatively similar to each other the silhouette coefficient for each point will be closer to $1$, while if a point is poorly classified and would likely fit better into a different cluster, the value will be closer to -1. The silhouette score can be calculated for a single point by using the formula $\\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{max(a(i),b(i)}$ where $a(i)$ is the mean distance between a point and all other points of the same cluster and $b(i)$ is the minimum of all possible mean distances between that point and all points of another cluster."

    "The movie data taken from TMDB is all publicly available information about the movies that have been subject to TMDB’s terms and conditions, and thus do not have any privacy infringements. Thus, in terms of the dataset, there is no highly sensitive information that is being handled and subsequently no visible ethical concern. However, ethical issues may arise in the form of biases, as the movie data may not include adequate amounts of foreign movies or films made by marginalized communities, and thus would not be completely representative of the industry as a whole since it only selects somewhat mainstream movies. This would limit the scope of our movie recommendation system to mostly movies released in the continental United States. We strive to make as unbiased a model as possible, and thus will be aware of these potential biases (as well as our own implicit biases) when conducting analysis into the data."
