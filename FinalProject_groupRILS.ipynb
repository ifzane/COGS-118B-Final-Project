    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s rapidly expanding entertainment industry, the sheer volume of movies, books, and other forms of media can easily overwhelm consumers. Especially the exponential growth of data caused particularly during the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw more and more people working and learning from home and used home entertainment options more often<a name=\"taylor\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#taylornote).  Spending hours just trying to find the perfect movie can be frustrating especially while navigating sheer amounts of content. Movie recommender systems however subtly changed the ways we make our choices. They offer a solution to this plethora of data by using machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior and preferences. By understanding the pattern of user interaction with movies, these systems can tailor recommendations to individual tastes, making the process of discovering new content more efficient and enjoyable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A study done by Jayalakshmi, Ganesh, Čep, and Murugan seeks to create an effective movie recommendation system by describing the challenges of the system and increasing its accuracy. In order to effectively suggest movies to users, there are three types of methods they discussed. One is collaborative filtering which analyzes user information/history. They look at what the user and users with the same demographic (age, sex, etc.) have watched in order to figure out a pattern in preferences. Content-based filtering looks at only the content of the movies and eliminates the problem where some users of the same demographic might not necessarily have the same taste in movies. Some examples they gave of content-based filtering is looking at the genre or the key characters of the movie. Lastly, context-based filtering takes into account how preferences stay the same across different platforms where “if both people are attracted to Christmas movies from Netflix, it is most likely that they will still like Christmas movies by Showmax””<a name=\"jayalakshmi\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#jayalakshminote). This research contributes to the development of more accurate and effective recommendation algorithms. Understanding the nuances of these recommendation algorithms is imperative for improving user experience and mitigating effects of information overload."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With the overabundance of movies to choose from, we wanted to create a streamlined system through which users could receive recommendations for movies based on existing titles they enjoy. To do this, we used unsupervised machine learning to train a model that will accurately recommend movies based on similarity (and other metrics such as popularity and user rating) to provide individuals with a more tailored recommendation experience. The initial framework of the model is created through PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering to group the data. The recommendation part of our project comes from regression, which takes into account factors such as movie genre, popularity, and user rating of certain titles. This way, users will receive recommendations that are close in taste to their liked movies, as well as others that are popular but might be a bit different from their likes to diversify their experience. The success of the recommendation system can be measured through metrics such as the silhouette score for cluster quality. The problem of movie recommendation is easily replicable due to the constant release of new films. Additionally, the usefulness of our recommendation system is not limited to films alone, as it will be able to successfully recommend other things with similar information (such as TV shows and cartoons), thus ensuring the relevance of our project.
