# COGS 118B Project (Group RILS)

This is the repository for the WI24 COGS 118B Final Project for the RILS Group. We created a Movie Recommendation System based on K-Means Clustering and Logistic Regression. 

**Group Members**: 
- Rebecca Du
- Lauren Himpelmann
- Stephanie Lew
- Ian Zane

**Dataset**:
- We used the [Movies Daily Update Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies) from Kaggle. Click the link in the name to be directed to the page to download the dataset. Due to the large size of the dataset, it was not included in this repository directly. 

**Files**:
- Proposal_groupRILS.ipynb: Our initial proposal for the project
- FinalProject_groupRILS.ipynb: Our final writeup for the project
- All_Code.ipynb: As the name suggests, all our code for the project
- CombiningUserRating.ipynb: An attempt at combining the user ratings for the various movies
